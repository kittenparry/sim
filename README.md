# sim
A human simulation project. An ant colony of sorts.

#### Current Features
* Human needs: hunger, sleep
	* eating raw berries and stuff in nature
	* sleeping on ground or in designated "shelter" places
* Humans dying, mostly from hunger since they pass out when too sleepy
	* Check [death.log](sim/logs/death.log) out!
